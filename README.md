# About

For the moment, these utilities allow you to convert a VRM
to a [ShaderMotion](https://github.com/CuteWaterBeary/ShaderMotion/)
MeshPlayer and export it as a GLB.

These utilities do NOT depend on VRChat, nor do they depend
directly on my VRChat 3D Loader Gimmick.  
**HOWEVER THEY REQUIRE THE **
**[VRChat 3D Loader Shaders PACKAGE](https://github.com/vr-voyage/vrchat-glb-loader-shaders)** 

## VRM To ShaderMotion GLB

To do this, you'll need to
[install the VRM 1.0 tools](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases)
along with these utilities.

Then :
* Drag-and-drop the VRM you want to convert into the scene
* Locate the Animator when inspecting root object
* Right click on it and select **Generate ShaderMotion GLB from this model**
* Choose where to save the GLB file
* Wait for the operation to complete. This takes at least 1 minute.
